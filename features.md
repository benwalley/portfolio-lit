### Next Steps (From development-steps.md)

#### Phase 3: Terminal Application
- [ ] Terminal component with command line interface
- [ ] Simulated filesystem in local storage
- [ ] Command parser and executor
- [ ] Basic commands (ls, cd, pwd, mkdir, touch, cat, etc.)
- [ ] Command history and tab completion
- [ ] Terminal theming

#### Phase 4: Applications
- [ ] About/Resume app with personal info
- [ ] Project showcase with iframe wrapper
- [ ] Settings app for configuration
- [ ] Contact app

#### Phase 5: Polish & Optimization
- [ ] Window animations (open, close, minimize, maximize)
- [ ] Mobile responsive improvements
- [ ] Performance optimizations
- [ ] Accessibility audit
- [ ] Cross-browser testing

## Known Issues/Limitations
- No terminal application yet
- No actual content apps yet
- Mobile experience needs refinement
- Window animations need implementation
- No persistent window state restoration on reload (only theme persists)

## Browser Compatibility
- ✅ Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- ✅ WebKit-based browsers
- ⚠️  Mobile browsers (functional but not fully optimized)

## Accessibility Features
- ✅ ARIA labels on all interactive elements
- ✅ Keyboard navigation support
- ✅ Focus indicators
- ✅ Screen reader friendly
- ✅ Reduced motion support
- ✅ High contrast mode
- ✅ Semantic HTML structure

## Performance
- ✅ Efficient Lit rendering with reactive properties
- ✅ CSS transforms for smooth animations
- ✅ Debounced resize handlers
- ✅ Debounced local storage saves
- ✅ No unnecessary re-renders
- ⚠️  Room for optimization with code splitting

## Development Environment
- **Dev Server**: Running on http://localhost:5173/
- **Hot Module Replacement**: ✅ Working
- **Build Tool**: Vite 7.1.9
- **Framework**: Lit 3.3.1
- **Context**: @lit/context 1.1.6
