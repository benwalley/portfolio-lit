## Step 1 - Plan Architecture
- Review the claude.md file for project requirements and features.
- Decide on the overall architecture and structure of the application.
- Choose the appropriate technologies and libraries (e.g., Lit, Vite).
- Plan the component hierarchy and how they will interact with each other.
 - Plan the state management.
 - Make a step by step development plan and document it in a new file called development-steps.md.
 - Think long and review the development steps, and update it as necessary to be the best possible.
 - performance is important, so consider performance implications of architectural decisions.
 

## Step 2 - Set Up Architecture
- Install necessary dependencies and set up the development environment.
- Create file structure for components, styles, state, etc
- Review development-steps.md and update as necessary.

## Step 3 - Implement Core Features
 - Using the plan created in development-steps.md, start implementing the core features of the application.
 - Focus on getting the main functionality working first (e.g., window system, draggable windows, resizable windows).
 - If necessary, update the plan as you go.
 - Keep in mind the architecture and best practices to make sure it's well architected and has clean code.
 - Create the code step by step, until the core features are implemented.
 - Create a features.md file to document the features as they are implemented.
